                  I didn't set out to build a community.<br />
                  I was simply searching for balance.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Like many of us, I found myself pulled in different directionsâ€”doing work that looked impressive 
                  from the outside but left me feeling scattered inside. Productivity without presence. Movement without meaning.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  It was only when I pausedâ€”through yoga, quiet walks, and creative expressionâ€”that I began to hear 
                  myself again. Not just the loud thoughts, but the soft, truthful ones underneath. That's when the 
                  idea began to growâ€¦ not of a company, but of a commune.

                  A space.<br />
                  A gathering.<br />
                  Where people could come as they are.<br />
                  Not to escape life, but to meet it more fully.

                  Not as a fixed state, but as something we learn to return to. Together.

                  This isn't about being perfect or peaceful all the time.<br />

                  And finding our way back to ourselves.
